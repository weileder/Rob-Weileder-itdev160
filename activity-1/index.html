      <h1>Home renovation by repurposing discarded items.</h1>
        <p>In the past few years, I have come to realize that we are
          quickly becoming a <q>disposible society.</q> <br />People would rather
          replace old worn out items around their homes with newly
          manufactured items. They throw away doors, hardware, lighting
          fixtures, and furniture because it no longer suits their moods
          or needs. There are alternatives that are much better for our
          planet and much more satisfying.
        </p>
      <h2>There are lots of items that can be reused.</h2>
        <p>There are many items that can be <b>repurposed</b> into other things
          or even just repainted to suit a new color scheme. Below is a list
          of some household items that can be <b>repurposed</b> in one way or another.
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Doors, both interior and exterior</li>
            <li>Lighting fixtures</li>
            <li>Window sashes</li>
            <li>Tables</li>
            <li>Furniture</li>
            <li>Dishes</li>
            <li>Flower pots</li>
          </ul>
        <p><i>Doors</i> can be refinished and have glass panels installed to use
          as pantry or powder room doors. <i>Lighting fixtures</i> can be repainted
          to go with a new color scheme. Old <i>windows sashes</i> can be hung in a
          random pattern on a wall to create an artistic feel. The wood from
          <i>tables</i> can be used to make smaller decorative items, such as frames
          and shelves. Worn <i>furniture</i> can be recovered and even have new padding
          put in. <i>Dishes</i> can be used to create multi-level desert plates by
          gluing coffee or tea cups in between plates. <i>Flower pots</i> can be
          painted and used to hold pencils or charging cords and adapters.
