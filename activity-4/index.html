      <h3 id="My-Thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          The Define S2 is an easy case to build just about any system in.</br>Whether you want to air cool,
          water cool with an All-In-One (AIO) cpu cooler, or go with a custom water loop, you will find
          that there is plenty of room inside this case. Wire management is made wasy through the use of
          grommets and teh psu shroud. On the back side of the motherboard, you will find multiple tie
          downs for tidying up your cables. The tempered glass sid epanel allows the builder to showcase
          their build, even with using rgb lighting components. </br>

      <h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
        <p id="Customer-Reviews">
          A Beautiful Case - David C.</br><b>Pros:</b> I came to this from a Rosewill BlackHawk Ultra Super Tower case and man, this is better than that by a mile. It's
          not quite as big, but the build quality is solid. It's a quaint case with an amazing full glass side panel to show off all your hard work.
          Well worth it.</br><b>Cons:</b> For me, personally, none.</br>
          </br>

          Great case, if it fits what you need. - Louis M.</br><b>Pros:</b> Better airflow path and higher airflow than the older R5 and the glass side with stock fans
          is quiet with custom fan curves. Enough for my Thread-ripper build and air cooler. Can go water cooled in future, but I hope not to need it with
          Ryzen 3. Make sure it can fit all of your storage. For a normal build it should be able, but no old school 5 1/4 drive slots.</br>
          <b>Cons:</b> I have a blackout R5. I don't like my computers with visible non-blackout materials, so I bought this normally cheaper s2 black with
          white fans and white back slot covers. I would not have done it had I not been able to swap out my non-visible blackout r5 pieces with the white
          s2 pieces with glass side cover.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Exceeded Expectations - Anonymous</br><b>Pros:</b> A solid case that had more features and functions than I was expecting (and none of the RGB cruft).
          I was looking for a front USB type 3. The noise reduction layers are great. A noisy PC is a bad PC in my book. Decent, non-junky power button. Great
          design details for cooling, fans, cables etc.</br><b>Cons:</b> Not a biggie, but its curious to get a black case with white fans and PCI covers.
          Maybe I'll like it more eventually.</br>
